Calender Wizard

This a simple project made using C language.

You can simply download and run the .exe file in your computer.

It's made to run like a CLI console type application using most of the basic concepts of C.
It won't show you the current date and time (as of now?) But it has the following features:

Prints a monthly interactive calendar based of the input year and month.
Prints day name for the given date.
Provide ability to create reminders on specific days of a month (like a birthday).
Has different color schemes.
